# RainmeterCodeGenerator
This code was to automate putting my classes onto my desktop as clickable shortcuts using the software Rainmeter. This code will script the code in Rainmeter format using prompts to the user.

This program has no dependencies. The user is asked how many links they would like to generate in Rainmeter. Then, the code will loop that many times. For each link, the user will be prompted to fill in the blanks. After they have, the code will use their input to replace variables in the Rainmeter template code. Finally, the output is printed in the console for copy and pasting.

*Note: This code scripts out a template code specifically for the Buttons theme. The output may need adjusting depending on the package you are using.*
